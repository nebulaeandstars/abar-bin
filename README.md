# ABar

This is my own personal abar configuration, and as such it uses tools and shell
scripts that are not included in this repository. This is here as reference
material for users of abar, or for use by anyone that has my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/nebulaeandstars/dotfiles).

While this repository can technically be used as a template for your own abar
configuration, that is not its purpose. You're probably looking for the actual
abar repository over [here](https://github.com/nebulaeandstars/abar).
